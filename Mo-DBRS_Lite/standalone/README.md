# PIC Controller

PIC controller is a fairly old and reliable microchip that can be programmed to perform specific functions. Raspberry Pi runs complete Linux Distribution, which leaves you at the mercy of its scheduler if you are trying to implement time-precise, Real-Time programs. On the other hand microcontrollers have precise peripheral timers which gives you much higer accuracy and robustness if your task is simple enough to be implemented on such resource-limited (processing power, memory...) device.

There are many ways to program PIC Controller. Additional components required:
