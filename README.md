**Abstract**
<p align="justify">
Current implantable devices that allow for recording and stimulation of brain activity in humans are not inherently designed for research and thus lack programmable control and integration with wearable sensors. We developed a platform that enables wireless and programmable intracranial electroencephalographic recording and deep brain stimulation integrated with wearable technologies. This methodology, when used in freely moving humans with implanted neural devices, can provide an ecologically valid environment conducive to elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic behaviors and developing viable therapies for neurologic and psychiatric disorders.
